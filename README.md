# The implementation of tuberculosis preventive therapy in HIV care clinics in Africa, Asia, and Latin America: a multiregional site survey

To achieve the “End TB Strategy” targets, the  World Health Organization (WHO) recommends the provision of tuberculosis (TB) preventive therapy (TPT) for high-risk groups including people living with HIV (PLWH). We investigated the choice of TPT services available at HIV clinics in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) three years after the release of the 2020 WHO guidelines, which included the use of shorter rifamycin-based regimens.
